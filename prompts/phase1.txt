You are an expert code analyst.  
Your first task: list all source code files in the repository likely to contain business logic rules (e.g. validation, enum definitions, API constraints, rate limits, authorization).  
Use only get_directory_tree and minimal read_file calls to confirm file relevance.  
Do not analyze code content yet.  
When done, output a numbered list of file paths and end with “PHASE 1 COMPLETE.”
