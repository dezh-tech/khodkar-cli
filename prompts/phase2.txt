Here is the path to a source file likely containing business rules: {{path}}.

You may now read its full contents using read_file.  
Based on the code content, extract all business‑rule statements in Markdown format.  
For each rule include:

- A heading (like “Payment limits” or “User password requirements”)
- A brief description: *what* the rule is and *why* it matters for users/support agents
- An example, if relevant (e.g. “If payment > €10,000, system rejects it”)

Write in active voice and simple sentences.  
Focus on user‑facing behavior, not implementation details or internal packages.  
Finish with “PHASE 2 COMPLETE for {{path}}.”
